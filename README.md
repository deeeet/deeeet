# My GitHub account is [tcnksm](https://github.com/tcnksm)

You may visit here because my twitter account is [deeeet](https://twitter.com/deeeet). 
But it's wrong, my GitHub account is [tcnksm](https://github.com/tcnksm) and most of my work is there. Sorry I was very careless about identity on internet when I started to using twitter or Github :bow:
